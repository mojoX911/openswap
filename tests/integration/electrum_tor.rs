//! Electrum over a real Tor SOCKS5 proxy, under the most adverse abort paths.
//!
//! These reuse existing scenario bodies verbatim via [`TorElectrumBackend`], so
//! they assert the *same* balances as their non-Tor counterparts. A Tor-specific
//! divergence in any watchtower path therefore fails loudly instead of degrading
//! silently.
//!
//! Why these three scenarios, in terms of watchtower coverage:
//!
//! - `abort1` — the taker vanishes *after* funding is on-chain, so makers must
//!   detect it autonomously with no ZMQ and no mempool scan: `subscribe_script` /
//!   `poll_event`, the preimage/hashlock cascade, timelock fallback, and
//!   `unsubscribe_script` on cleanup. Run over both protocols.
//! - `reboot_recovery` — the only scenario that restarts a maker mid-swap, hence
//!   the only one exercising the watcher's startup re-subscribe of persisted
//!   watches, which is the path most exposed to Tor circuit churn.
//! - `malice2` — the only scenario driving the taker's breach detector.
//!
//! ## Requirements and gating
//!
//! An ephemeral onion service must upload its descriptor to the HSDir ring and
//! the client must fetch it back, so these **cannot work offline**. They are
//! `#[ignore]`d and additionally require `COINSWAP_TOR_IT=1`, and they *skip*
//! rather than fail when Tor is missing. Run them with:
//!
//! ```text
//! COINSWAP_TOR_IT=1 cargo test --features integration-test electrum_tor \
//!     -- --ignored --test-threads=1 --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! `tor` must be listening on `TOR_CONTROL_PORT` / `TOR_SOCKS_PORT` and be fully
//! bootstrapped. Set `COINSWAP_TOR_PASSWORD` if the control port needs one.
//!
//! Note the onion services are created with `Flags=Detach`, so they outlive the
//! test process. That is deliberate — the CI job's tor is ephemeral and drops
//! them on restart.
