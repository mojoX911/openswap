//! Electrum-protocol backend.

//! Electrum servers index chain data by scripthash and have no server-side

//! expects (UTXO listing, descriptor expansion, block-hash lookups) using local

//! `blockchain.headers.subscribe` + per-script `scripthash.subscribe`. Coin
//! locking is handled wallet-side, not here.
